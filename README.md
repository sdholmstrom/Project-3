# Project-3: TradeSmart Analyzer
## The Idea: Blend Fundamental and Technical Analysis Techniques to Identify and Guide Investment Opportunities
Fundamental Analysis measures a security's intrinsic value by examining related economic and financial factors. Intrinsic value is the value of an investment based on the issuing company's financial situation and current market and economic conditions.

Technical Analysis is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities by analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and volume. Unlike fundamental analysis, which attempts to evaluate a security's value based on business results such as sales and earnings, technical analysis focuses on the study of price and volume.

By utilizing these two methods we can identify a healthy investment opportunity AND when the ideal time is to jump in or jump out.

## Instructions:
Intrinsic Value Calculation:
1. Load imports and ensure your .env file has a valid API key. The Financial Modeling Prep api requires a paid subscription for access to quarterly financial data that is used within our model.
2. Update the ticker object in cell 2.
3. Run all cells and view the output components (Intrinsic Value, Current Share Price, and Margin of Safety) to see if your selected stock is over or undervalued.

Technical Analysis (Simple Moving Averages):
1. Install the necessary libraries (yfinance, pandas, hvplot, holoviews, and numpy).
2. Copy the code (HVPlot.ipynb) into a Python file and run the script.
3. The script will prompt you to input a stock ticker symbol. For example, you can input "AAPL" for Apple Inc. (ensure it's a valid ticker symbol for a publicly traded company).
4. The script will download historical stock price data, calculate moving averages (50-day and 100-day), generate buy and sell signals based on moving average crossovers, and create visualizations of the stock's price chart with entry and exit points marked.

"Trade Smart Analyzer - Stock Prediction App

This application, built using Streamlit, provides a user-friendly interface for predicting stocks based on their intrinsic values. By leveraging the power of data analysis and financial modeling, Trade Smart Analyzer offers insights into potential investment opportunities. 

To get started, ensure you have Python installed on your machine along with the necessary dependencies listed in the 'requirements.txt' file. Once you've set up the environment, run the 'app.py' script to launch the application. 

Upon launching the app, you'll be greeted with an intuitive interface where you can input the relevant stock information, such as ticker symbol, financial metrics, and market trends. The app then employs advanced algorithms to calculate the intrinsic value of the stock, taking into account various factors like earnings growth, discounted cash flows, and market comparables.

The predictions generated by Trade Smart Analyzer are meant to serve as a guide for making informed investment decisions. However, it's important to note that these predictions are based on historical data and market trends, and they should not be regarded as financial advice.

Feel free to explore the various features and functionalities of Trade Smart Analyzer, including interactive visualizations, historical performance analysis, and the ability to compare multiple stocks simultaneously.

## Analysis Summary:
The component pieces of our application work as designed; the DCF model produces a margin of over or undervalue of a specific stock. The limitations of the DCF model are evident when looking at growth companies or those that have recently exoerienced changes in FCF trends. Apple which has a strong FCF performance produces a seemingly close intrinsic value, while showing it is slightly overvalued by the market right now (8% overvalued).
![AAPLIntrinsicValue](README%20Visuals/AAPL%20Intrinsic%20Value.png)

Target, having recently experienced some negative FCF quarters produces a much lower intrinsic value and would suggest it is nowhere close to being worthy of purchase. If the investor has a postiion in TGT, they would do well to get out right now.
![TGTIntrinsicValue](README%20Visuals/TGT%20Intrinsic%20Value.png)

At least part of the limitations of this particular DCF model can be explained by the influential assumptions made around FCF projections, growth rates, and discount rate. Each of these components would be better served in a later iteration to be modeled out individually and in a more thorough approach.

Technical Analysis Summary:

In summary, this script allows users to input a stock ticker symbol, retrieves historical stock price data, calculates moving averages, generates buy and sell signals based on SMA crossovers, and visualizes the stock's price chart with entry and exit points marked. This can be a useful tool for technical analysis and trading strategy development. 

Use this script as a learning tool to understand how moving averages and basic technical analysis can be applied to stock data. Experiment with different ticker symbols and parameters to gain insights into stock price trends.
