# Project-3: TradeSmart Analyzer
## The Idea: Blend Fundamental and Technical Analysis Techniques to Identify and Guide Invement Opportunities
Fundamental Analysis measures a security's intrinsic value by examining related economic and financial factors. Intrinsic value is the value of an investment based on the issuing company's financial situation and current market and economic conditions.

Technical Analysis is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities by analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and volume. Unlike fundamental analysis, which attempts to evaluate a security's value based on business results such as sales and earnings, technical analysis focuses on the study of price and volume.

By utilizing these two methods we can identify a healthy investment opportunity AND when the ideal time is to jump in or jump out.
